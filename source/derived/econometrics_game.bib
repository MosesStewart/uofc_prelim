	abstract = {Understanding the economic impact of surface temperatures is an important question for both economic development and climate change policy. This study shows that in 28 Caribbean-basin countries, the response of economic output to increased temperatures is structurally similar to the response of labor productivity to high temperatures, a mechanism omitted from economic models of future climate change. This similarity is demonstrated by isolating the direct influence of temperature from that of tropical cyclones, an important correlate. Notably, output losses occurring in nonagricultural production (–2.4\%/+1 °C) substantially exceed losses occurring in agricultural production (–0.1\%/+1 °C). Thus, these results suggest that current models of future climate change that focus on agricultural impacts but omit the response of workers to thermal stress may underestimate the global economic costs of climate change.},

	abstract = {We argue that occupations are a key explanatory variable for understanding the early transmission of COVID-19 in New York City, finding that they play a larger role than other key demographics such as race or income. Moreover, we find no evidence that commuting patterns are significant after controlling for occupations. On the other hand, racial disparities still persist for Blacks and Hispanics compared with Whites, although the disparities’ magnitudes are economically small. We perform our analysis over a range of several weeks to evaluate how different channels interact with the progression of the pandemic and the stay-at-home order. While the coefficient magnitudes of many occupations and demographics decrease, we find evidence consistent with higher intra-household contagion over time. Finally, our results also suggest that crowded spaces play a more important role than population density in the spread of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {New York City is the hot spot of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This paper merges information on the number of tests and the number of infections at the New York City zip code level with demographic and socioeconomic information from the decennial census and the American Community Surveys. People residing in poor or immigrant neighborhoods were less likely to be tested; but the likelihood that a test was positive was larger in those neighborhoods, as well as in neighborhoods with larger households or predominantly black populations. The rate of infection in the population depends on both the frequency of tests and on the fraction of positive tests among those tested. The non-randomness in testing across New York City neighborhoods indicates that the observed correlation between the rate of infection and the socioeconomic characteristics of a community tells an incomplete story of how the pandemic evolved in a congested urban setting.},

	abstract = {Motivated by reports  in the media suggesting unequal access to Covid-19 testing across incomes, we analyze  zip-code level data on the number of Covid-19 tests, test results, and income per capita in New York City.  We find that the number of  tests administered is evenly distributed across income levels.  In particular, the test distribution across income levels  is significantly more egalitarian than the distribution of income itself: The ten  percent of the city's population living in the richest zip codes  received 11 percent of the Covid-19 tests and  29 percent of the city's income. The ten percent of the city's population living in the poorest zip codes received 10 percent of the tests but only  4 percent of  the city's income. At the same time, we find significant disparity in the fraction of tests that come back negative for  the Covid-19 disease across income levels: moving from the poorest zip codes to the richest zip codes is associated with an increase in the fraction of negative  Covid-19 test results    from 38   to 65  percent.},
